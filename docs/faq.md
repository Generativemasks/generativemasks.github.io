# FAQ

### WHAT IS "Generativemasks"?

Generativemasks is a Generative Art NFT project based in Japan.

### MORE SPECIFICALLY?

One of the most unique things about the project and the NFT is that this NFT automatically generates masks with different expressions. What does that mean? This means that when you reload your mask or masks on the NFT marketplaces like OpenSea, you will be able to see a different colored mask with different expressions in patterns and shapes! And it happens every time you refresh your webpage. Yes, every time.

### WHO IS THE ARTIST?

The artwork was created by Takawo Shunsuke (Twitter: [@takawo](https://twitter.com/takawo/)). He is a college professor and a creative coder in Japan. Takawo is really passionate about daily coding and his areas of expertise are design process, media art and digital fabrication.

### DO WE GET DMS OR MESSAGE FRON THE TEAM?

We possibly might contact you to talk about something specific, (If you reach out to us for questions or things like that!) but one thing that we want you to know and you need to be aware of is

**We never ever ask you for sending any ETH or tokens.**  
 **WE NEVER DO IT**

So even though it's not us (TEAM), Somebody within the community reaches out to you and ask you for ETH or tokens, You should never answer, but please report it to us.

We will immediately take the proper action to deal with it.

### SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE ROLE VERIFICATION. WHY?

There are two main things you need to check in order to get the role process done.

‚ë† Make sure the address you are trying to connect to in collabland must be the same as the wallet you are holding the NFT.  
 ÔºàAfter checking ‚ë†, I recommend you trying one more here.Ôºâ

‚ë° Check your address of the mask NFT is correct for our contract address.  
 (Make sure that their alphanumeric match correctly)

Our contract address is here:  
 [https://etherscan.io/address/0x80416304142fa37929f8a4eee83ee7d2dac12d7c](https://etherscan.io/address/0x80416304142fa37929f8a4eee83ee7d2dac12d7c)

The alphanumeric you see (0x80416304142fa3~) is our contract address.  
 If you're not familiar with the word, that's okay.

But you need to know this alphanumeric should be the same as your URL of the NFT.  
 If you see the same alphanumeric there, it should be fine!

In the case you use OpenSea, your URL of the NFT should be like this (ex: OpeanSea)

Example: [https://opensea.io/assets/0x80416304142fa37929f8a4eee83ee7d2dac12d7c/012345](https://opensea.io/assets/0x80416304142fa37929f8a4eee83ee7d2dac12d7c/012345)  
 (_\*This is just an example, you'll see errors if you go to the link_)
