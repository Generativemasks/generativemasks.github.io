Generativemasks is a Generative Art NFT project based in Japan. MORE SPECIFICALLY? One of the most unique things about the project and the NFT is that this NFT automatically generates masks with different expressions. What does that mean? This means that when you reload your mask or masks on the NFT marketplaces like OpenSea, you will be able to see a different colored mask with different expressions in patterns and shapes! And it happens every time you refresh your webpage. Yes, every time. WHO IS THE ARTIST? The artwork was created by Takawo Shunsuke (Twitter: @takawo ). He is a college professor and a creative coder in Japan. Takawo is really passionate about daily coding and his areas of expertise are design process, media art and digital fabrication. And all of his proceeds from the project will be donated to the following organizations and groups. - Processing Foundation - Processing Community Japan - OpenProcessing - NEORT - Coolors https://twitter.com/takawo/status/1427444590890557454 You can see more details from his official website. Artist information WHEN WAS THE RELEASE DATE? It was August 17th, 2021, around 11:00 AM (\"JST\"- Japan Standard time, UTC+9) DO WE HAVE SOME UPCOMING EVENTS? We've started planning on doing some events! We'll definitely let you know via \ud83d\udd08announcements channel. So make sure you're following it!! WHERE IS THE OFFICIAL WEBPAGE? Here it is! https://generativemasks.on.fleek.co/#/ WHAT ROLES DO WE HAVE? Now, We have... \u300eMASK HOLDER\u300f\u21d2 People who have a mask or masks. \u300ePOAP HOLDER\u300f\u21d2 People who got our poap. \u300eTEAM\u300f\u21d2 Team members of Generativemasks. \u300eARTIST\u300f\u21d2 @takawo That's all for now, but May have several more. We\u2019ll see! WHAT IS THE FUTURE ROADMAP OF THE PROJECT? Yes, We've shared our Roadmap and our Vision on the official Webpage . We really want you to take a look! DOES Generativemasks HAVE TWITTER? Yes, it does! https://twitter.com/generativemasks \u300eGenerativemask\u300fIS THAT YOU? No. Absolutely Not. We already found out that there is a couple of fake accounts and collections. We're gonna keep trying to deal with them though, please please make sure and note that the Real one always has \"s\" at the end of the word. Example: \u300cGenerativemask\u300d\u21d2 \u2715 \u300cGenerativemasks\u300d\u21d2 \u25ef SO, WHERE IS THE REAL ONE? THE COLLECTION? Here is our official verified OpeaSea collection : WHAT WAS THE MINT PRICE? The original mint price was 0.1 eth. (For ALL) IS RARITY SET IN THIS NFT? No, there is no rarity setting for this NFT. DO WE GET DMS OR MESSAGE FRON THE TEAM? We possibly might contact you to talk about something specific, (If you reach out to us for questions or things like that!) but one thing that we want you to know and you need to be aware of is We never ever ask you for sending any ETH or tokens. WE NEVER DO IT So even though it's not us (TEAM), Somebody within the community reaches out to you and ask you for ETH or tokens, You should never answer, but please report it to us. We will immediately take the proper action to deal with it. SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE ROLE VERIFICATION. WHY? There are two main things you need to check in order to get the role process done. \u2460 Make sure the address you are trying to connect to in collabland must be the same as the wallet you are holding the NFT. \uff08After checking \u2460, I recommend you trying one more here.\uff09 \u2461 Check your address of the mask NFT is correct for our contract address. (Make sure that their alphanumeric match correctly) Our contract address is here: https://etherscan.io/address/0x80416304142fa37929f8a4eee83ee7d2dac12d7c The alphanumeric you see (0x80416304142fa3~) is our contract address. If you're not familiar with the word, that's okay. But you need to know this alphanumeric should be the same as your URL of the NFT. If you see the same alphanumeric there, it should be fine! In the case you use OpenSea, your URL of the NFT should be like this (ex: OpeanSea) Example: https://opensea.io/assets/0x80416304142fa37929f8a4eee83ee7d2dac12d7c/012345 ( *This is just an example, you'll see errors if you go to the link ) _ If you need help with this, you can drop me a message!
